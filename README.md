# Introduction
There are a number of packages in R, Python, and other languages that can perform linear regression analysis (LRA) on a given dataset.  While the use of these packages saves a data scientist or analysis quite a bit of time, it is important to do these from scratch every now and then to reenforce the concepts behind this most fundamental of machine learning algorithms.  By doing so, we deepen our intuitions that allow us to make better use of the available tools.

In this project, an LRA was performed on a dataset of characteristics (features) related to the number of abalone rings which was treated as the independent or response variable.  This analysis was performed in two ways.  First, it was done "from scratch" using just base R language constructs such as matrix operations.  Second, the analysis is duplicated using the caret package.

The analysis starts with a quick exploratory data analyisis (EDA) which begins with standardizing the indepependent variables (features) before constructing a matrix of scatter plots in order to gain a high level understanding of the relationships between feature pairs. The features analyzed were: Sex (Male, Female, or Infant), Length, Diameter, Height, Whole weight, Shucked weight, Viscera weight, and Shell weight.

Following the pairs plot, the construction of the linear model was initiated by randomly partitioning the data into training and test sets. Following the data partitioning, the coefficients for the linear model were calculated for various ridge regression parameters (<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21862473/images/gif.latex.gif" title="lambda" />) on the training set.  The <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21862473/images/gif.latex.gif" title="lambda" /> which minimized the root mean square error (RMSE) was determined and then used in the model to make predictions on the held-out test set.
